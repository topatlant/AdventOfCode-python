# AdventOfCode-python

Solutions to some Advent of Code puzzles, written in Python, incl. tests

Emphasis was on writing elegant, pythonic code - not speed, optimisation or conciseness.
So if you find something that can be written more elegantly (whatever that is), send me a pull request ;-)

- to run the tests: run `py.test`
- to run all code: todo

## Prerequisites

- some puzzles need `numpy`
- code is targeting Python 3.9 currently
