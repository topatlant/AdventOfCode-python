# AdventOfCode-python
Solutions to some of the Advent of Code puzzles, written in Python, incl. tests

Emphasis was on writing elegant, pythonic code - not speed, optimisation or conciseness.
So if you find something that can be written more elegantly (whatever that is), send me a pull request ;-)

- to run the tests: run `py.test`
- to run all code: todo
